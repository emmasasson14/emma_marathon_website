<h1>Team for Kids</h1>
<p>On November 5, 2023, I will be participating in the New York City Marathon to raise money through <a href="https://runwithtfk.org/" target="_blank">Team for Kids</a> for <a href="https://www.nyrr.org/youth"target="_blank">New York Road Runners </a> youth programs. especially motivated knowing that these funds will benefit such a worthy cause.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nyrr.org/youth" target="_blank">Rising New York Road Runners</a> - NYRRâ€™s youth program and events platform - serves more than 240,000 students locally and nationally through free NYRR youth running programs, events, and resources. These programs promote healthy lifestyles and empower youth development via running and character-building programs in schools and community centers nationwide.</p>

<p>My goals are to complete the race and to meet my personal goal to raise $2,620 for NYRR youth programs. You may choose to make a pledge of $20 or more. My fundraising page can be found at this <a href="https://runwithtfk.org/Profile/PublicPage/102110" target="_blank">link</a>. Your donation is fully tax deductible and you will receive an email letter of acknowledgment for your tax records.</p>

<p>Please join me in supporting this cause and get kids running toward a brighter, healthier future!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Emma</p>
