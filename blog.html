            <p> Okay, here it is! It is officially official... I have started my New York City Marathon training journey and I couldn't be more excited, nervous, confused, scared, elated... and welp, pumped. So as to not be overly cliché by announcing this as my 2023 New Years Resolution, I, in fact, started this goal a week <em>before </em> New Years... thank you very much. Just in case marathon training wasn't hard enough on its own &#128517 ... I have also decided to track my journey in front of the world, in front of YOU, on this website, that I am also at the same time learning how to build. So like not too much going on this year... </p>
            
            <p>So why am I doing this you ask? Well, growing up, I was always outside, always playing sports, always moving. I was a collegiate water polo athlete for all four years, and now, being a graduated sort of adult person, with a new job that requires a lot of sitting around, I have missed the thrill of challenging my body physically, my mind mentally, and I want to push my body farther than it ever has gone before. A marathon is 26.2 miles long, and I intend to complete one on November 5, 2023. </p>
            
            <p>Okay, but why the website? Why not just post on your Insta story? Well, I will be! But, I also want to learn how to program, and how to build websites, and why not test this out with something that means a lot to me?
            </p>

            <p> My goal with this page is to document each week's worth of physical and mental training, recovery and nutrition to share with all of you! I hope that this is something that is not only valuable to me, but also to those of you who are reading.</p>

            <p> To preface, I have a background of mostly water sports. I was a swimmer from the ages 7 to 11, and played water polo through high school and college until the graduting in 2016. The year after I swore off pools for 365 days, and decided to run a half marathon. I did end up completing it, but not without major pain from my hips to my toes for about a month afterwards. I sort of trained okay by following a running plan, but I was not great at focusing on my strengh, mobility and recovery so it wasn't really the most enjoyable journey. This time, I want it to be the opposite of my last race. I want to focus on building a solid base for the next few months so that I can be the strongest runner I can be. Thank you for following along, and well... let's run!</p>

        <h2>Week 1</h2>

            <p> First week DONE! This marathon journey is going to be exactly that, <em> a journey</em> and I am excited to have a chance to really enjoy every single part of the process and be in the moment. </p>

            <p> Since I have never done this before, I have decided to look up a helpful guide to running my first marathon. After researching, I happened upon a wonderful book written by, Ali Nolan, called <u>Master the Marathon</u>. Ali Nolan is a well-known journalist and writer who has had plenty of running experience and has completed her fair share of marathons. What drew me to this book was that it was curated for women's bodies in particular. Googling plans on the internet is definitely one way to train, and I did that method for my one and only half marathon a few years ago. Though, after getting hurt, and not really feeling well after that run, I was excited to find a guide specifically for women.</p>

            <p> There are multiple training guides in this book for every level runner, and for me, I am starting out as a beginner/intermediate. So for the next 22 weeks, I am setting up what Ali calls, "Pre-Base". This is essentially priming my body for what's to come. It mixes a balanced about of light runs (all time-based), body weight workouts, walking and rest throughout the week.</p>

            <p> This week, I started out with a 20 minute walk on Monday, 15 minute run on Tuesday, strength training on Wednesday, a 15 minute run on Thurdsday and a 30 minute long run on Sunday. I had to switch up the days a bit this week as I was out of town, but hey... gotta remain flexible and get all my workouts in when and where I can!</p>

            <p> As for recovery, I love my foam roller, and I also got myself a roller ball to hit my feet as well before and after working out. Oh also, my two pugs wante to make sure my feet were in great condition... </p>

            <p> I also should mention, before any workout, I go through a <em> dynamic warmup </em>. I cannot tell you what a game changer this is. This warms your body up for what's to come, and it has significantly helped me feel evem more primed up for my workout. For me this week, I mixed in some lunges with twists, leg swings, toe and heel walks, along with some butt kickers and high knees to get ready. </p>

            <p> Total mileage (walk/run) for the first week: <strong> 5.67 miles</strong></p>
