                <p> Week 12 let's go!</p>

                <p>Hey everyone!</p>
                    
                &nbsp;
                <p> I am feeling so pumped and energized right now!<p>
                    &nbsp;
                <p>I ran three separate times this week, and kept to my regular schedule. Even better, I didn't let a little thing like traveling to Phoenix stop me from getting my runs in. The Saturday before my long run, I flew into Phoenix, went to a Spring Training Padres game and Taylor Swift concert! AH! And let me tell you, that concert was an absolute EXPERIENCE! Taylor was amazing and the energy in the arena was just electric. I can't wait to see her again.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                <p> I've also been doing really well with my diet lately. I've been eating a lot of kale and other healthy foods, and I can really feel the difference in my energy levels. It's amazing how much better you can feel when you fuel your body with the right stuff.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                <p> Finally, my strength training is going really well. I've been hitting my goals and making progress, which is always exciting. I will admit, I haven't been as consistent with my mobility exercises as I should be, but that's okay. I know I can get back on track and keep making progress.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                <p>  All in all, this has been an amazing week so far and I'm feeling so grateful and excited for everything that's happening. I hope you all are having a great week too! Keep pushing yourself and chasing your goals, because anything is possible if you believe in yourself.</p>
