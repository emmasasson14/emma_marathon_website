                &nbsp; 
            
              
                <p>Hello, hello!! It has definitely been quite a bit since I have last updated my running blog. Rest assured I have kept up with my training for the most part, but took some time away from the good 'ole blogging.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                <p>Now that I am back, I have some updates on my progress!</p>
                    &nbsp;
                <p>Over the past few weeks, I got a tad under the weather, and didn't keep up with as much strength and mobilty as I would have liked. During the end of Week 14, I could definitely feel more pain in my joints, i.e knees, ankles, and also my shins on my long run day.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                <p>  This past week though, I kicked it back into gear, and felt the positive benefits of strength training for my running. Not only do I feel like a strong runner, but little aches and pains seem to just disappear the moment I go back to my gym workouts. </p>

                &nbsp;

                <p>  Some helpful exercises I make sure to include are: squats, single leg RDLs, weighted calf raises, and hip flexor strengthening (leg raises, band work and fire hydrants) </p>

                &nbsp;

                <p> To top it all off, this week ended with my longest run yet logging 5.03 miles, so progress is HAPPENING!! </p>
